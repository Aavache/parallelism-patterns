## Introduction

Concurrency and parallelism are essential in modern computing to fully utilize multi-core processors. Python's `multiprocessing` module provides a powerful framework for creating parallel programs. This repository serves as a guide to understanding and implementing various multiprocessing design patterns.

## Design Patterns

### Parallel Execution (Parallelism)

- **Pattern Description:** Divide a task into smaller subtasks and execute them concurrently in separate processes.
- **Use Case:** When you have CPU-bound tasks that can be parallelized to utilize multiple CPU cores effectively.
- **Python Modules:** `multiprocessing.Pool`, `concurrent.futures.ProcessPoolExecutor`

### Map-Reduce

- **Pattern Description:** Divide a large dataset into smaller chunks, process them concurrently in separate processes (Map), and then aggregate the results (Reduce).
- **Use Case:** Commonly used in data processing and analysis tasks.
- **Python Modules:** `multiprocessing.Pool`, `concurrent.futures.ProcessPoolExecutor`

### Worker Pool

- **Pattern Description:** Create a pool of worker processes that can handle incoming tasks from a queue.
- **Use Case:** Useful for tasks where work items arrive asynchronously and need to be processed in parallel.
- **Python Modules:** `multiprocessing.Pool`, `multiprocessing.Queue`

### Producer-Consumer

- **Pattern Description:** Divide the work between producer processes (generate data) and consumer processes (consume and process data).
- **Use Case:** Useful for scenarios where data is produced at a different rate than it is consumed.
- **Python Modules:** `multiprocessing.Queue`, `threading.Thread` (for managing producer and consumer threads)

### Master-Worker

- **Pattern Description:** A master process manages a group of worker processes, distributing tasks to workers and collecting results.
- **Use Case:** Suitable for scenarios where there is a central coordinator/master and multiple worker processes.
- **Python Modules:** Custom implementation using `multiprocessing.Process` or libraries like Celery.

### Pipeline

- **Pattern Description:** Divide a complex task into multiple stages, each handled by a separate process. Data flows from one stage to another through inter-process communication.
- **Use Case:** When you want to create a multi-stage processing pipeline with parallelism.
- **Python Modules:** `multiprocessing.Pipe`, `multiprocessing.Queue`

### Shared Data

- **Pattern Description:** Multiple processes share data or resources while ensuring proper synchronization and coordination to avoid race conditions.
- **Use Case:** When processes need to collaborate and share information, but you must ensure data integrity.
- **Python Modules:** `multiprocessing.Manager`, `multiprocessing.Lock`, `multiprocessing.Semaphore`

### Thread Pool with Multiprocessing

- **Pattern Description:** Combine multithreading and multiprocessing to take advantage of both multi-core processors and concurrency within each core.
- **Use Case:** Useful when you want to perform parallel tasks with further parallelism within each task.
- **Python Modules:** `threading.Thread` with `multiprocessing.Pool`

### Asynchronous Processing

- **Pattern Description:** Use asynchronous programming libraries like `asyncio` with multiprocessing to handle asynchronous I/O-bound tasks concurrently.
- **Use Case:** When dealing with I/O-bound operations that can benefit from parallelism.
- **Python Modules:** `asyncio`, `asyncio.run_in_executor` with `concurrent.futures.ProcessPoolExecutor`
